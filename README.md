# SoulLeash
Minecraft 1.21 Plugin (Paper)
Allows players to be leashed!

Right-click a player with a lead to leash them.
The owner can remove the leash by using a sword.
The owner can make the leashed player look at them by using a Totem of Undying.
The owner can teleport the leashed player to themselves by using a Nether Star.
The owner can also tie the leashed player to a fence.

Leashed players will receive a regeneration effect.
The owner can also feed food items to their leashed players.

A distance check is included:

If the player is more than 48 blocks away, they will be teleported directly.
If the distance exceeds 10 blocks, a warning will be shown.

Permissions (none are granted by default, recommend using LuckPerms):
leashplayers.use — Allows using leads on players
leashplayers.leashable — Allows being leashed by others
